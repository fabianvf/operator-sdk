      The Ansible Operator proxy will now return a 500 if it cannot determine whether
      a resource is virtual or not, instead of continuing on and skipping the cache.
      This will prevent resources that should have ownerReferences injected from
      being created without them, which would leave the user in a state that cannot be
      recovered without manual intervention.
