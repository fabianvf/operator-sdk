      The `meta` variable passed to Ansible playbooks and roles
      has been renamed to `ansible_operator_meta`.
    kind: "change"
    breaking: true
    migration:
      header: Ansible Operator `meta` variable renamed to `ansible_operator_meta`
      body: |
        All existing references to the `meta` variable in your Ansible content will
        no longer work. Instead, your Ansible content should reference the
        `ansible_operator_meta` variable.

        Alternatively, you can use the `vars` keyword in your `watches.yaml` in order
        to map the new `ansible_operator_meta` variable to `meta`. Below is a sample
        `watches.yaml` that has made this change:

        ```yaml
            - version: v1alpha1
              group: test.example.com
              kind: Example
              role: test
              vars:
                meta: '{{ ansible_operator_meta }}'
        ```
