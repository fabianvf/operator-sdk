      The scaffolded manager deployment for Ansible-based Operators now
      has the `ANSIBLE_GATHERING` option set to `explicit`. Additionally,
      if the `ANSIBLE_GATHERING` environment variable is set to explicit
      when running a role directly, the `--role-skip-facts` argument will
      be passed to `ansible-runner`.

    kind: "bugfix"

      header: Ansible Operator fact gathering causes performance regression
      body: |
        To disable fact gathering by default for your operator, you will need to
        add the following entry to the manager container in`config/manager/manager.yaml`:

        ```yaml
                  env:
                    - name: ANSIBLE_GATHERING
                      value: explicit
        ```
